# learning_code
Here you can view my path in learning programming

Taking baby steps to achieve amateur goals.
I've started from c++ and later im planning to include py and java in my package.
My plan is that github will be like a programming diary for me and it will help me be more consistant.

July 10th: Didnt have a lot of time for programming today but pushed one contribution anyway. Spent most of the day fighting Linux's command line, found out a lot of interesting features, some of them are even useful. :)
